### About Me 👨‍💻

👤 I'm Jose ([@joseandopro](https://x.com/joseandopro) on X), a Systems Engineer passionate about technology and web development. I specialize in creating websites with WordPress, using tools like Oxygen Builder to deliver customized and optimized solutions. With experience in SEO, web security, and performance optimization (WPO), I help businesses enhance their online presence.

I enjoy working independently, building projects from scratch, and managing every detail with dedication. I'm currently building my own web agency, offering comprehensive web management services, from maintenance to design and development.

When I'm not coding, I love learning about biology, reading, and exploring new ways to improve my physical and mental well-being.

Let's connect and build something great together! 🚀
